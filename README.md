(f.k.a. "Water-Distribution-Network-Model")


Introduction
------------
EPANET is used to perform extended-period simulation of the hydraulic and water quality behavior within drinking water distribution systems (e.g., pressurized pipe networks), which consist of pipes, nodes (junctions), pumps, valves, storage tanks, and reservoirs. It can be used to track the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each node, the height of the water in each tank, a chemical concentration, the age of the water, and source tracing throughout the network during a simulation period.

EPANET was developed as a tool for understanding the movement and fate of drinking water constituents within distribution systems, and can be used for many different kinds of applications in distribution systems analysis. Today, engineers and consultants use EPANET to design and size new water infrastructure, retrofit existing aging infrastructure, optimize operations of tanks and pumps, reduce energy usage, investigate water quality problems, and prepare for emergencies. EPANET can also be used to model contamination threats and evaluate resilience to security threats or natural disasters.

This is the official EPANET source code repository maintained by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPANET source code is written in the C Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.

Intended Audience
-----------------
The intended audience for this repository can be divided roughly into two groups:

 - Programmers interested in water distribution system modeling
 - Engineers working on water distribution system modeling interested in programming

EPANET has an active open source software community including consulting engineers, students, researchers, software companies, professional organizations, other interested members of the public, and EPA partners. An Open Source EPANET Initiative at http://community.wateranalytics.org has released source code for an EPANET engine version 2.1 that included community sourced bug fixes and they are working on additional releases with new feature requests. Others are encouraged to fork EPANET and develop a great new feature to share with the community.
